# icons9-frontend

### What is this?
This is a tool that displays the FontAwesome (fa) and MaterialDesign icons (mdi) svg sets.  
It lets you search thru the icons, and change colors, and allows you to save the icons for export.  
Or click a icon to copy it to the clipboard in a format that lets you paste straight into design tools  
like Figma.

The reason for this project is that other pages where you can search for these icons tend to be slow  
and more limited. 

### Project setup
